# Separate Completed Changes from Data Refresh Failures

## Practice

After a create, update, or delete request succeeds, an app may send another request to reload the displayed data. Treat the completed change and the data reload as separate results.

If reloading the data fails, tell the user that the change was completed but the latest data could not be loaded. Do not report the completed change as failed.

## Apply When

- The app reloads a list or detail view after a create, update, or delete request succeeds.
- Users need different messages depending on whether the change request or the data reload fails.
- Retrying a completed change after a data reload failure could create duplicates or repeat an operation.
- The app can determine that the change succeeded independently of whether the latest data can be loaded.

## Do Not Apply When

- A user action is not considered successful until its follow-up work is complete, such as confirming a payment.
- The app can safely update the displayed data from the successful create, update, or delete response without sending another request.
- The client receives one combined result instead of separate results for the change and the data reload.

## Why

A create, update, or delete request and the request that reloads the displayed data are separate requests. If the first request succeeds but reloading the data fails, the completed change remains successful.

When the same `try/catch` handles both requests, a data reload failure can be presented as though the change itself failed. The user may then retry a request that has already succeeded, creating duplicate data or repeating the operation.

Report the completed change first. If reloading the data fails, use the app's error handling for loading data to report that failure separately. This lets the user understand what succeeded and what failed.

## Implementation Guidance

- Run the create, update, or delete request in its own `try/catch`.
- If the request fails, stop without showing a success message or reloading the data.
- If the request succeeds, show a success message before reloading the data.
- Run `refresh()` outside the first `try/catch`.
- If `refresh()` fails, keep the success message and report the data-loading error separately.
- Decide whether the user must wait for `refresh()` to finish or can continue while the data reloads in the background.

## Minimal Nuxt Example

```ts
const { refresh } = await useProjects();
const updateProject = useUpdateProject();

const handleSubmit = async (input: UpdateProjectInput) => {
  try {
    await updateProject(input);
  }
  catch {
    return;
  }

  addNotification({
    type: "success",
    title: "Project Updated",
  });

  // useProjects reports a data-loading error if refresh() fails.
  await refresh();
};
```

The `catch` handles only the update request. The data reload starts after the update succeeds and remains outside that `catch`. `useProjects()` shows a reload failure, so the submit handler does not show the same error again.

## App Examples

- [`UpdateDiscussion.vue`](../../../apps/bulletproof-nuxt/layers/discussions/app/components/UpdateDiscussion.vue) handles the update request in its own `try/catch`, shows `Discussion Updated`, and then calls `refresh()` outside that `try/catch`.
- [`UsersList.vue`](../../../apps/bulletproof-nuxt/layers/users/app/components/UsersList.vue) shows the `User Deleted` message after a successful deletion and reloads the user list separately. It waits for the reload to finish before closing the deletion confirmation dialog.

## Trade-offs and Limitations

A success message followed by a data-loading error may appear contradictory. The two messages report separate results: the change succeeded, but the latest data could not be loaded.

Waiting for the data to reload delays completion. Reloading in the background lets the user continue sooner, but the displayed data may remain out of date until the reload succeeds.

A failed data reload may throw an error from `refresh()` or finish with `status` set to `"error"`. Code that needs to distinguish success from failure must handle both cases.

Request cancellation, preventing duplicate submissions, and handling work that finishes after a component unmounts require separate lifecycle decisions.
