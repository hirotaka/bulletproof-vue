# Pragmatic Nuxt

A collection of practical Nuxt showcases exploring different approaches to full-stack web development.

## About

This repository explores practical approaches to Nuxt development. Rather than prescribing a single "correct" way, we try various tools, patterns, and libraries to understand their trade-offs in real-world scenarios.

What you'll find here:

- **Exploration over dogma** - We try different approaches and share what we learn
- **Practical examples** - Real applications with tests, not just toy demos
- **Diverse options** - So many great libraries to choose from, that's what makes it fun

> **Note**: This repository was previously named `bulletproof-vue`. The showcases retain the "Bulletproof" branding as they are inspired by [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react).
