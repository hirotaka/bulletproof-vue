VitePress is a Static Site Generator (SSG) built on Vite and Vue 3. It takes Markdown content, applies a theme, and generates static HTML that becomes an SPA for fast navigation. Perfect for documentation, blogs, and marketing sites.

**Key Characteristics:**
- File-based routing with `.md` files
- Vue components work directly in Markdown
- Fast HMR with instant updates (<100ms)
- Default theme optimized for documentation
- Built-in search (local or Algolia)

**Before working with VitePress projects:**
- Check `.vitepress/config.ts` for site configuration
- Look at `.vitepress/theme/` for custom theme extensions
- The `public/` directory contains static assets served as-is
